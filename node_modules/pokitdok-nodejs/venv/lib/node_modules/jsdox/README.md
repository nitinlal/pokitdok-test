jsdox is a simple jsdoc 3 generator.  It pulls documentation tags based on a subset of [jsdoc 3](http://usejsdoc.org/) from your javascript files and generates [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files.

Relies on the [JSDoc3 parser](https://github.com/mrjoelkemp/jsdoc3-parser) to get the full AST including comments
